# EmotionsClassifier
**GM Analytics Emotions Image Classifier App.**

Human emotions are complex psychological states that involve a range of feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. They are crucial for personal experiences, social interactions, and overall mental health. Common emotions include happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, love, nervousness, and surprise, each playing a unique role in human behavior and communication.

**Project Overview**

This project aims to classify human emotions from images using a deep learning model. By leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, we have built a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately predict emotions such as happy, sad, angry, disgust, love, nervous, and surprise from facial expressions in images. The model was trained on a diverse dataset of emotional images to ensure robust performance.

**Deployed on Streamlit Cloud.**

To make this model accessible, we have developed a Streamlit web application. Users can input the URL of an image, and the app will display the image along with the predicted emotion. Additionally, the app evaluates the model's performance on a test dataset and plots the training history, including accuracy and loss over epochs. This user-friendly interface allows for easy interaction and visualization of the model's capabilities in real-time. This project not only demonstrates the application of deep learning in emotion recognition but also showcases the deployment of machine learning models through an interactive web application.
